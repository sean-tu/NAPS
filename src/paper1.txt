Abstract The fracture of metallic nanowires has
attracted much attention owing to its reliability of
application in nanoelectromechanical system. In this
paper, we studied the fracture of [100] single-crystal
gold nanowire subjected to uniaxial
tension. The
statistical breaking position distributions showed that
the size effects had dominated the deformation and
fracture of nanowires, and the quasi-static tensile
deformations are insensitive to the styles of tensile
rates. Furthermore, it was observed that the small-
sized nanowire broke in the middle with disordered
crystalline structure; for the middle-sized nanowire,
although slippage plane had maintained the lattice
degree, the fracture also happened in the middle due to
symmetric tension; for the large-sized nanowire, the
slippage was destroyed by symmetric tension, which
induced the broken neck at one end of the nanowire.

When the nanowire width is less than 5a (‘‘a’’ means
lattice constant, 0.408 nm for gold), the mechanical
strength is relatively strong with obvious uncertainty,
which can be attributed to the surface atom effect;
when the width is larger than 5a, the inﬂuence of size
on the mechanical property is more obvious at the
constant strain rate than that at the absolute rate.
Finally,
the mechanical strength of the nanowire
decreases with the size increasing.

Introduction

In recent years, the metallic nanowire has attracted
increasing attention owing to their special mechanical
(Diao et al. 2003),
thermal (Miao et al. 2005),
electrical (Melosh et al. 2003), and magnetic (Alex-
androv and Kabanov 2005) properties. As part of
nanoconnector (Wu et al. 2005) and active compo-
nents of nanoelectromechanical
system (NEMS)
device (Husain et al. 2003; Lieber 2003), the defor-
mation and fracture of the nanowire are directly
related with the reliability of NEMS, which usually
requires a fundamental description about the defor-
mation mechanism of nanowires (Hemker 2004).
Because the size of nanowires is very small, it is
difﬁcult to manipulate and control the deformation

Methodology

To reveal the dependence of absolute rate and strain
rate on the fracture of the gold nanowire at different
sizes, MD simulations were performed to study the
deformation behaviors of single-crystal gold nano-
wires. As shown in Fig. 1, geometric models of face-
centered cubic (FCC) were generated as a regular
lattice along the [100] crystallographic orientations.
The rectangular cross-sectional shape was from the
previous work, in which the dynamic characterization
of the postbreaking behavior of a nanowire was
investigated by incorporation of MD simulation and
experimental MCBJ in a wide range of strain rates
(Zhao et al. 2008a). The geometric dimensions of the
nanowire were set as La 9 Wa 9 Ha (L, W, and H
the
stand for
nanowire,
lattice
constant, 0.408 nm for gold). The previous results
indicated that, the mean-square error of the stress was
a stable value for copper nanowires with an aspect
ratio of about (1:3) (Liu et al. 2009; Liu and Zhao
2011), which might be enough to minimize the
constraints posed by rigid boundaries on the tops
and bottoms of the gold nanowires. In this study, the
ratio of L:W:H was ﬁxed to be 1:1:3, and the height of
the nanowire varied from 9a (3.672 nm) to 36a
(14.69 nm). For the model in Fig. 1, both ends with
three lattices were set as ﬁxed layers, and others were
the thermal controlled layers of the nanowire. Before
the nanowire was relaxed under zero
stretching,

Muller et al. 1992a), and mechanically controllable
break junctions (MCBJ) (Muller et al. 1992b; Hemker
2004). However, molecular dynamics (MD) simula-
tion (Allen and Tildesley 1997; Rapaport 2004), which
solves Newton’s equations of motion for a collection
of interacting particle over a number of time steps, is
an effective method to study the deformation and
fracture properties of metallic nanowires.

have demonstrated that
stacking fault and surface energies is crucial
in
capturing the fundamental deformation behavior of
gold nanowires. Hasmy and Medina (2002) have
studied the thickness induced structural transition in
suspended face-centered cubic (FCC) metal nano-
ﬁlms, and demonstrated that surface reconstruction
only occurred in 5d metals. Liu et al. (2009) have
showed that
the copper
nanowire is dependant on the nanowire length. These
studies indicate that size effect is of vital importance
for developing and processing the nanoscale systems
of metallic nanowires. For the single crystal materials,
the plastic response could occur rapidly with the
strong mechanical shock. For example, amorphization
in nickel nanowire can be induced by high strain rate
(Ikeda et al. 1999). Moreover, a competition between
tensile shocks and atomic vacancies was discovered
for the tensile deformation of the gold nanowire at
different strain rates (Wang et al. 2011b). Therefore,
the size effect in single crystal materials would be
related to the mechanical shock with different tensile
rates. However,
is not clear which factor will
dominate the deformation and fracture mechanism of
nanowires.

In order to make this question clear, it is very
necessary to study the effect of size and tensile rate on
the tensile deformation and fracture of nanowires.
Here, different initial equilibrium states were designed
to investigate statistically size effects on the uniaxial
tensile manipulation of the gold nanowire with two
different tensile rates. The results indicated that size
effect had dominated the deformation mechanism of
nanowires, and the tensile actions with different rates
could only affect the deformation processes.

traction (xy-plane) and zero stress (z-direction). With
increasing relaxation time,
the equilibration was
achieved when the recorded average potential energy
per atom reached to a stable state. After that, the
uniaxial tension was performed via moving the ﬁxed
layers at two ends, and the tension was applied along
the direction of nanowire height. The strain rate was
deﬁned as _e ¼ de=dt (ps-1), which was the rate of
change in strain (e) with respect to time (t). Whereas,
the absolute rate with the unit of m s-1 was deﬁned as
the rate of change in displacement vector with respect
to time. The constant strain rate was set as 1.00 % ps-1
for all sizes, corresponding to absolute rates from
36.72 to 146.9 m s-1 at part (I) of Table 1. With
statistical analysis, the most probable broken position
(MPBP) was got from the ﬁtting peak of broken
position distribution of the single-crystal gold nano-
wire. According to the MPBP of the nanowire with
size of (8a 9 8a 9 24a), the constant absolute rate
was selected as 97.92 m s-1. For each height at part
(II) of Table 1,
the constant absolute rate of
97.92 m s-1 corresponded to strain rates from 0.667
to 2.667 % ps-1. The strain rates and the absolute rates
of nanowires both plotting against the width of the
nanowire at two tensile rates, are shown in Figs. S1a
and b. From Fig. S1, it could be seen that when the
strain rate was constant at part (I), the corresponding
absolute rate increased with the width of the nanowire

Table 1 The simulation conditions of nanowires

increasing. For the constant absolute rate at part (II),
the corresponding strain rate decreased with an
increase in width of the nanowire. In total, there were
two different tensile rates for ten different sizes. At
each condition, different and sufﬁcient relaxation time
was adopted for the nanowire to get 300 initial
equilibrium states. For the size (8a 9 8a 9 24a), the
absolute rate of 97.92 m s-1 corresponded to the
strain rate of 1.00 % ps-1. So a total samples of 5,700
{(10 ? 9) 9 300} were performed for the tensile
deformation of gold single-crystal nanowires.

All the presented MD simulations and visualization
processes were performed with the software NanoMD
(Zhao et al. 2008b). The single-crystal gold nanowires
were subjected to uniaxial tension by moving two
ﬁxed layers uniformly along the tensile z-direction.
The Verlet
leapfrog algorithm was used for the
integration of motion equations to obtain velocity
and trajectories of atoms, which were adopted under
free boundary condition. As a rescaling method of
velocity, Nos´e–Hoover thermostat (Nos´e 1984a, b;
Hoover 1985) was used to maintain the system at
300 K. The interaction between gold atoms was
described through embedded-atom method (EAM)
potential
function developed by Johnson (1989),
which could provide an effective description of the
transition metals with the FCC structure. The total
energy was given by

Results and discussion

Effect of size on deformation under different
tensile rates

From atomic view, size effect could induce different
ways of atomic movements (Wang et al. 2014), which
were related with mechanical shocks at different
tensile rates. From Fig. 2a–c,
it can be seen the
representative deformation characteristics of nano-
wires by MD simulation method, when the nanowires
are subjected to uniaxial tension at the strain rate of
1.00 % ps-1. From Fig. 2a, (see Supplementary Video
S1), the observed structure at state h1i shows that the
atoms in the corner collapse inward. It is because that
surface atoms account for a large proportion, and free
relaxation in xy-plane could easily destroy the original

crystalline structure. During uniaxial stretching, it can
be seen that
the whole deformation of the gold
nanowire with size (4a 9 4a 9 12a) shows disor-
dered crystalline structure. The irreversible structural
the state h3i, Fig. 2a,
rearrangement appears at
indicating plastic deformation has happened in the
nanowire. From the ampliﬁed atomic conﬁguration
h3-Ai in Fig. 2a, a disordered structure is observed to
concentrate in the middle region of the nanowire.
Upon further stretching, a broken neck appears at the
state h6i in Fig. 2a with amorphous structure (see the
state h6-Bi, Fig. 2a), then the nanowire breaks in the
middle. When the nanowire size increases
to
(5a 9 5a 9 15a) at the strain rate of 1.00 % ps-1
(Wang et al. 2011a), the nanowire remains perfect
crystalline form in the deformation process. After the
initial elastic deformation, slippage planes appear only
with some amorphous structure at the edge of the
nanowire. Upon further stretching, the slippage along
(111) plane becomes more and more obvious with
increasing strain, which is in agreement with the
slippage mechanism proposed by Finbow et al. (1997).
When the overall rupture eventually happens, the
nanowire breaks completely along the slippage plane,
and symmetric stretching makes slippage in the
middle region of
the size
(8a 9 8a 9 24a), (corresponding to Video S2), slip-
page planes appear
in the process of nanowire
deformation (see h3-Ai, Fig. 2b). However, the sym-
metric stretching has slightly damaged the slippage
planes. After further stretching, a broken neck appears
and a fracture happens at one end of the nanowire (see
h6-Bi, Fig. 2b). When the size continues to increase to
(12a 9 12a 9 36a) (see Fig. 2c and Supplementary
Video S3), slippage planes are blocked at two ends of
the nanowire by symmetric stretch. In comparison
with Fig. 2b,
the nanowire maintains an ordered
crystalline structure at the beginning of the plastic
deformation (see h3-Ai, Fig. 2c). With strain increas-
ing, local amorphous appears around the two broken
necks (see the state h6-Bi, Fig. 2c). The appearances
of broken positions are mainly related with size,
tensile rate, and temperature (Wang et al. 2011a, b, c,
2012). While for the broken necks at two ends in this
study, size effect has dominated the fracture behavior
(Ikeda et al. 1999; Koh and Lee 2006). In the view of
crystalline, the effect of size on the order degree of
crystalline structure could be observed from a com-
parison of their radial distribution functions (RDF). As

shown in Fig. 2d, the RDF peaks of the nanowire with
small size (4a 9 4a 9 12a) are rough in the nearest
neighbor distance of RDF, attributing to acute atomic
movement induced by surface atom effect. With the
size increasing, the RDF peaks in Fig. 2e and f become
sharp and smooth in the near neighbor distance, and
some small peaks appear in the further neighbor
distance, indicating the crystalline structure of the
nanowire has maintained very well. From Fig. 2d–f,
the h1i curves are sharp, indicating the nanowire
retains perfect crystalline structures at the beginning

of deformation. Later, peak heights in the h2i curves
decrease obviously in the near neighbor distance,
which can be attributed to the appearance of disor-
dered crystalline structure in the deformation of the
nanowire.

In order to observe inﬂuences of strain rate and
absolute rate on nanowire fracture under size effect,
we have studied the representative deformation
behaviors of the [100] single-crystal gold nanowires
at the absolute rate of 97.92 m s-1. As shown in
Fig. 3a (see Supplementary Video S4) with nanowire

tion at the state h2i, Fig. 3a, the nanowire exhibits a

to the strain rate of

tary Video S5), the slippage dominates the whole
deformation of the nanowire. With strain increasing,
local disordered structure appears at one end of the
nanowire (see the state h3-Ai, Fig. 3b). With sym-
metric stretch, the broken neck appears in the nano-
wire (12a 9 12a 9 36a) with some disordered atoms
(see the state h6-Bi, Fig. 3b). Comparing with Fig. 2c,
the main difference is the appearance of one broken
neck in Fig. 3b, which can be attributed to the weak
mechanical shock induced by the decreasing of strain
rate.

rate

The above deformation behaviors have demonstrated
that the increasing of strain rate could facilitate the
ductility of small-sized nanowire. Here, the maximum
average potential energy per atom is used to evaluate the
degree of lattice order in the tensile deformation process
of the nanowire. As shown in Fig. 4, the potential energy
at two tensile rates decreases with size increasing. At the
constant absolute rate of 97.92 m s-1, the decreasing
trend of the potential energy is in accord with a function
of E1 (eV) = -1.901 ? 0.190 9 exp (-W/4.051), and

energy is in accord with a function of E2 (eV) =
-1.900 ? 0.167 9 exp (-W/4.252), in which, E is the
maximum average potential energy per atom and W is
the width of the nanowire. The decreasing potential
energy indicates that the nanowire size does have effect
on the crystalline in the nanowire deformation process
which is from surface atoms for small-sized nanowire
and the bond broken induced by stretch. Different from
block atoms, surface atoms belong to imperfect atoms
with higher potential energies. During the tensile
deformation, the atomic bond breaking is a direct
consequence of atomic vibration overcoming the inter-
atomic cohesive energy, which in turn causes the
disordered crystalline structure. Then the breaking of
atomic bond results in the potential energy increasing.
By contrast, the potential energy E1 is higher than E2 at
nanowire width from 3a to 8a. If the width is longer than
8a, little deviation between E1 and E2 would appear. For
the nanowire with the same aspect ratio, because surface
atoms are typical
imperfect atoms that have high
potential energies, the size decreasing always brings
about the increasing of potential energy. In addition,
because mechanical shock with high strain rate could
easily induce bond breaking, the increasing of strain rate
usually results in potential energy increasing.

From the above results,

the single-crystal gold
nanowires present various deformation behaviors. At
the constant strain rates of 1.00 % ps-1, the nanowire
maintains disordered crystalline structure at size
(4a 9 4a 9 12a). When the
to
(12a 9 12a 9 36a), slippage occurs along the (111)
planes, and symmetric tension blocks the slippage
movement. Then two broken necks appear at two ends
of the nanowire. In other words, the broken position
has been transferred from the middle region to the end
of the nanowire under size effect. At the constant
absolute rate of 97.92 m s-1, the nanowire with size
(4a 9 4a 9 12a) exhibits a superplastic character
with amorphous structure. The fracture appears in the
middle region of the nanowire. While when the size
increases to (12a 9 12a 9 36a), only one broken
neck appears at one end of the nanowire.

Effect of size on the fracture under different tensile
rates

The ﬁnal broken positions of [100] single-crystal
gold nanowires occur at
the central part of the
small-sized nanowires. While with size increasing,

to break at

the nanowires are apt
the two ends,
which could also be regulated by tensile rate. In
microscopic viewpoint, different sizes could induce
different atomic ﬂuctuation ways, which are related
with deformation and fracture mechanisms of nano-
wires. Tensile shock induced by symmetric stretch
could affect
the atomic movement, which could
induce different ways of tensile wave propagation.
Holian and Straub (1979), Holian (1988), Kadau
et al. (2002), and Bringa et al. (2004) have studied
the wave propagation in solid materials and con-
cluded that microscopic mechanism of wave prop-
agation is inherently complex in solid materials
because the plastic ﬂow is governed by the creation
and motion of disordered crystalline structures in the
deformation of nanoscale material. For the wave
propagation, our previous work (Liu et al. 2009)
have compared the statistical results of the most
breaking position of copper nanowires from MD
simulations with the calculated results from shock
wave propagation theory, which indicated that the
calculated trend was in agreement with the statistical
one when the copper nanowire length was larger
than 4.7 nm. The researching results also indicated
the explanations for
the wave propagation were
feasible, though the propagation was indeed com-
plex owing to nanoscale effects.

Here, statistical histograms of the ﬁnal broken
positions are given to illustrate the relationships
between macro-breaking position distribution and
deformation mechanism induced by atomic movement
under the effects of size and tensile rate. The statistical
histograms are ﬁtted by Gaussian function, and the
ﬁtting peaks can replace the MPBP (Wang et al.
2011a, b, c, 2012). From Fig. 5a, it can be seen the
inﬂuence of size on the MPBP of the [100] single-
crystal gold nanowire at the strain rate of 1.00 % ps-1.
The MPBP transfers from the middle to the two ends
with the nanowire size increasing, which are in
agreement with the deformation mechanisms at
different sizes. For small-sized nanowire, atomic
ﬂuctuation is in a non-equilibrium state owing to the
surface atom effect. With symmetric stretch,
the
tensile wave propagates from two ends to the middle
part, and the wave superposition induces the increas-
ing of atomic potential energy, as a result,
the
nanowire breaks in the middle of the nanowire. With
the size increasing, slippage along (111) planes
dominates the stretching deformation, and the ordered

single-crystal gold
nanowires under size effect.

1.00 % ps-1. b The broken
position distributions of
nanowires at the constant
absolute rate of

size is in Table 1)

crystalline structure induced by slippage indicates that
the atomic ﬂuctuation is in an equilibrium state. When
uniaxial symmetric tension is applied at two ends of
the nanowire, the tensile wave overlaps in the middle
of the nanowire. Energy concentration induced by the
wave superposition leads to the neck breaking in
middle area of the nanowire, and the fracture of the
nanowire happens in the middle region. For the large-
sized nanowire (12a 9 12a 9 36a), the strain rate of
1.00 % ps-1 corresponds to the absolute rate of
146.9 m s-1. The broken position distributions at
two ends are consistent with the deformation mech-
anism that local amorphous induced by high absolute
rate has dominated the broken points at two ends of the
nanowire. With strong mechanical tension of high
absolute rate, symmetric stretch brings a large stress
gradient at two ends, inducing the difﬁculty of the
tensile wave propagation from two ends to the middle.
Therefore, the broken necks appear at two ends of the
nanowire, and the corresponding MPBPs also distrib-
ute at two ends.

bigger

With statistical analysis of the broken position
distribution at the strain rate of 1.00 % ps-1, the
inﬂuence of absolute rate on the fracture of the
nanowire is studied, and the constant absolute rate is
set at 97.92 m s-1 for all the sizes. As shown in
the
Table 1, when
than
(8a 9 8a 9 24a),
the corresponding strain rate is
lower than the strain rate of 1.00 % ps-1; similarly, the
strain rate becomes higher when the size is smaller
than (8a 9 8a 9 24a). For the broken position distri-
bution, the symmetric property in Fig. 5b is almost the
same as that at the strain rate of 1.00 % ps-1 in Fig. 5a.
The corresponding MPBP appears in the middle
region for small-sized nanowire. When the size is
larger than (8a 9 8a 9 24a), the broken positions at
two ends are relatively concentrated comparing with
the distribution in Fig. 5a, which corresponds to the
deformation with the decreasing of the corresponding
strain rate. The size of nanowire exhibits signiﬁcant
effect on the fracture properties. When symmetric
stretch is applied for the nanowire with small size,

atomic movement
is in the non-equilibrium state
owing to surface atomic effect. Disordered crystalline
structure induced by surface effect results in the
MPBP appearing in the middle part of the nanowire.
For
the middle-sized nanowire under symmetric
tension, the MPBP is still in the middle region because
of the appearance of slippage plane, and for large-
sized nanowire, the MPBPs at two ends are mainly
from atomic movement dominated by bulk atoms,
which corresponds to the deformation mechanism that
local amorphous is induced by the blocked slippage
planes.

From the viewpoint of the wave propagation,
symmetric actions at different rates have resulted in
different mechanical shocks, which could induce
different ways of tensile wave propagation. In the
tensile deformation of
the nanowire, mechanical
tension can disrupt the lattice order, inducing the
concentrated and dispersed energy in the wave prop-
agation. The atomic bonds with high energy will break
when the activated atoms have enough energy to
overcome the atomic cohesive energy. For small-sized
nanowire, the lattice order has been destroyed after
relaxation, a large stress gradient induced by non-
equilibrium stretch results in the difﬁculty of the
tensile wave propagation. Because the atomic energy
in the middle region is enhanced by the wave
superposition, the fracture is apt to appear in the
middle of the nanowire. The MPBP and MPBPs at
macro-broken position distributions show that the size
still dominates atomic movement of nanowires, and
the tensile shocks with different rates can only affect
the processes of the wave propagation. For middle-
sized nanowire, slippage plane retains the relative
order lattice, and the deformation stays in the quasi-
equilibrium state. Symmetric action brings about the
tensile wave superposition in the middle of the
nanowire, and the concentrated energy results in
MPBP in the middle area. For large-sized nanowire,
bulk atoms dominate the atomic movement style.
Symmetric tension disturbs the propagation of the
tensile wave from the two ends to the middle. The
concentrated energy induced by the wave superposi-
tion makes local amorphous at
two ends of the
nanowire. Generally, different styles of tensile wave
propagation for each size will result
in different
macro-broken position distributions, which can be
interpreted by the deformation mechanism of
nanowire.

Effect of size on mechanical property
under different tensile rates

The size effect on the atomic movement, which could
be affected by symmetric stretch with different tensile
rates, gives deep insight into mechanical fracture and
operation of the metallic nanowire. If we could predict
the deformation behavior with the relevant mechanical
property,
the fracture of the nanowire could be
controlled and strengthened at the broken position.
The mechanical properties of metallic materials are
usually characterized by using stress–strain relation-
ships,
the ﬁrst yield stress, strain, and Young’s
modulus, which may be helpful for the operation of
nanoscale device. As shown in Fig. 6a, the typical
stress–strain responses under size effect are given for
the [100] single-crystal gold nanowire subjected to
uniaxial tension with the strain rate 1.00 % ps-1.
Stress increases linearly with the strain increasing
before the ﬁrst yield point (the critical point between
elastic and plastic deformation), which is consistent
with elastic law (That is r1 = Ye1, r1, and e1 are the
ﬁrst yield strain and stress, respectively. Y is Young’s
modulus). The strain (e) is deﬁned as e = (l - l0)/l0,
where l is the current stretch length and l0 is the length
just after relaxation. The stress (r) in the tensile
direction is calculated by the Virial scheme (Wu
2006). When the stress decreases abruptly after the
ﬁrst yield point, the nanowire undergoes an irrevers-
ible deformation indicating the beginning of plastic
deformation. Subsequently, the yield cycle repeats
continuously with a decreasing trend, and the yield
cycle is over when the nanowire has no ability to
maintain its structure and ﬁnally breaks. During the
whole yielding cycle, the periodicity vibrations of the
stress–strain responses appear at all
the nanowire
sizes. The stress–strain curve is relatively smooth for
large size; while the stress at small size is scattered and
vibrated acutely with large amplitude. Therefore, it
can be seen that the crystal lattice vibrates acutely at
the equilibrium position under symmetric tension with
the same strain rate, and the atoms with large atomic
entropy could not be in a low energy state, so the stress
for small-sized nanowire tends to ﬂuctuate with large
amplitude.

To observe size effect on the ﬁrst yield point of the
nanowire, the ﬁrst yield strain, the ﬁrst yield stress and
Young’s modulus against the nanowire width, were
studied, respectively (Fig. 6b–d). The tensile rates

applied on nanowires are set as the strain rate of
1.0 % ps-1 and the absolute rate of 97.92 m s-1, and
the average statistical result is from 300 samples for
each condition. For the [100] single-crystal gold
nanowire with aspect ratio of (1:3), the width of
5a (‘‘a’’ means lattice constant, 0.408 nm for gold) is
the critical point for the mechanical property of the
nanowire. Less than the width of 5a, the ﬁrst yield
strain in Fig. 6b is about 0.05, and the relatively small
strain indicates the difﬁculty of retaining the elastic
deformation. When the width is larger than 5a, the ﬁrst
yield strain ﬂuctuates around 0.09. With the width
increasing, the ﬁrst yield strain is basically stable for
the constant strain rate of 1.00 % ps-1. However, the
ﬁrst yield strain shows a decreasing tend at
the
constant absolute rate of 97.92 m s-1, because of the
corresponding strain rate decreasing with the increas-
ing width of the nanowire (see Table 1). Selecting a
proper strain rate for simulations is important for the
quasi-equilibrium stretch research, which could avoid
the tensile rate effects as much as possible. The width
of 5a is also the critical point in Fig. 6c. When the
nanowire width is less than 5a, the stress with a big

error decreases abruptly. When the width is larger than
5a, the ﬁrst yield stress is not sensitive to the constant
absolute rate. However, the stress increases with the
width increasing at the strain rate 1.00 % ps-1. The
broken neck moves from the middle to the two ends of
the nanowire when the size increases. The blocked
slippage planes have improved the yield stress.
Young’s modulus (Y) is deﬁned by Sun (Sun 2007)
as the stress of a material divided by its strain in the
elastic deformation region, which may be used to
evaluate the mechanical strength of the nanowires. In
Fig. 6d, Young’s modulus exhibited an obvious size
dependant character. When the nanowire width is less
than 5a, Young’s modulus is about 170 Gpa with big
error. When the width is larger than 5a, Young’s
modulus ﬂuctuates around 70 GPa. From above
investigations, it can be seen that Young’s modulus
is insensitive to the constant absolute rate and the
strain rate. Therefore, it can be concluded that size
effect dominates the mechanical property in the quasi-
equilibrium deformation of nanowire.

The above mechanical properties correspond to
the deformation and fracture of nanowires under

the stretch of

the net

loading,

two ends,

the material. This

stretch leads

the center of wire,

size effect. The fracture belongs to the damage of
nanowire, which can be divided into two stages: fast
and slow. For
the middle-sized
nanowire,
tensile strengths of each cross
sections of the nanowire were initially identical.
After beginning symmetrical
the tensile
waves start to propagate from both ends and meet at
the center of the nanowire. Due to superposition of
two waves, the central cross section is loaded by
twice larger stress, which causes signiﬁcant
local
stretch of
to
rearrangement of surface and bulk atoms and the
appearance of broken neck along the slippage plane,
which decreases the cross-sectional area and net
tensile strength at
so the
nanowire breaks in the middle. This moment can
be considered as the beginning of the slow stage
with quasi-static stretch of nanowire. For the stretch
of the large-sized nanowire, bulk atoms dominate
the atomic movement
style. Symmetric tension
disturbs the propagation of the tensile wave, which
has been blocked at
inducing local
disordered crystalline structures. The broken neck
causes both of
the cross-sectional area and net
tensile strength decreasing. For the fast stage of the
damage process,
surface atom effect plays an
important role in the deformation of the small-sized
nanowire. Surface atoms are subject to the inward
force, which cannot be balanced by other atoms
inside. After relaxation,
the great surface tension
force leads to atom rearrangement in the nanowire.
Indeed,
this moment could be considered as the
beginning of the fast stage. During the fast damage
stage, symmetric tension could easily induce some
disordered crystalline structure,
leading to the
increasing of mechanical strength, which can be
attributed to surface atoms and the broken bond
atoms belonging to under-coordinated atoms. The
result is consistent with a bond-order-length-strength
correlation mechanism proposed by Sun (2007) that
atomic coordination imperfection could cause the
remaining atomic bonds to contract spontaneously.
Pauling (1947)
(1927) have
reported that the atomic coordination number reduc-
tion could cause shrinkage of atomic size, or the
contraction of the remaining bonds,
inducing an
increase in strength of atom bonds.

Conclusion

In summary, the deformation, fracture, and mechan-
ical properties of nanowires were studied by MD
simulations. It was observed that (i) with symmetric
uniaxial tension, size effect has dominated the defor-
mation and fracture mechanism of the nanowire. The
deformations mainly appear as disordered crystalline
structures, slippage, and local amorphization for
small, middle, and large-sized nanowires, respec-
tively; (ii) the statistical broken position distributions
demonstrated that atomic movement induced by size
effect has dominated the fracture of nanowire. The
quasi-static tensile deformations could be affected by
the tensile action, which was insensitive to the styles
of tensile rates; and (iii) the mechanical strength of the
nanowire decreased with the size increasing, which
could be attributed to the damage of nanowire.
