Description:
  NAPS is an academic article classifier and storage tool. This software will allow users to upload PDF files. Text information from the PDF will then be extracted with relevant information identified and classified by its contents. Once classified, the article will be stored in a database that will keep track of the articles information (i.e. author, date of publication, etc).  Users can easily view and search their organized documents.
