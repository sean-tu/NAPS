the  off-target   sequences   and   their   adjacent   PAMs   to  be  present   in   the   genome.   Our   results   demonstrate
that   while   many   crRNAs   are  functional,   less   than   5%   of   crRNAs   with   two   mismatches   to   their   target   are
effective   in   gene   editing;   this   suggests   an   overall   high   level   of   functionality   but   low   level   of   off-targeting.

1.  Introduction

The  CRISPR–Cas9  system  is  a  highly  effective  and  simple  tech-
nique  for  modifying  the  genome  of  higher  eukaryotes,  particularly
mammalian  cells  that  have  not  been  readily  amenable  to  gene
editing.  In  the  short  period  since  the  initial  discovery  of  efﬁ-
cacy  in  mammalian  cells  (Cong  et  al.,  2013;  Mali  et  al.,  2013;
Jinek  et  al.,  2013;  Cho  et  al.,  2013),  there  have  been  numerous
studies  that  demonstrate  the  utility  of  the  CRISPR–Cas9  system

for  genome  engineering,  from  performing  whole-genome-scale
knockout  screens  elucidating  gene  function  in  cell  culture  (Shalem
et  al.,  2014;  Wang  et  al.,  2014),  to  creating  multiple  mutations  mod-
eling  tumors  in  the  livers  and  lungs  of  adult  mice  (Xue  et  al.,  2014;
Platt  et  al.,  2014)  and  creating  mutations  in  the  brains  of  adult  mice
(Swiech  et  al.,  2015).  This  CRISPR  system  requires  the  Cas9  nucle-
ase  along  with  two   short  RNA  molecules,  the  guiding  CRISPR  RNA
(crRNA)  and  the  trans-activating  crRNA  (tracrRNA),  that  hybridize
to  each  other  and  direct  Cas9  to  the  target  location  for  cleavage
based  on  sequence  complementarity  to  the  crRNA  as  well  as  prox-
imity  of  the  DNA  target  to  a  protospacer  adjacent  motif  (PAM).  In
2012,  Jinek  et  al.  (2012)  demonstrated  that  the  two  small  RNAs,
crRNA  and  tracrRNA,  can  be  combined  into  a  single  guide  RNA
(sgRNA)  that  can  be  expressed  in  mammalian  cells.  While  the  effec-
tiveness  and  universality  of  CRISPR–Cas9  for  genome  engineering
in  mammalian  systems  has  been  clearly  demonstrated,  the  activity
and  speciﬁcity  of  a  particular  crRNA  or  chimeric  sgRNA  is  less  clear.
The  ability  of  any  given  crRNA  to  efﬁciently  create  a  DSB  in  the
target  DNA  can  vary  based  on  the  guide  RNA  (gRNA;  either  crRNA
or  sgRNA)  sequence  and  position  in  the  targeted  gene  (Shalem
et  al.,  2014;  Wang  et  al.,  2014;  Koike-Yusa  et  al.,  2014).  A  recent

study  has  identiﬁed  sgRNA  design  rules  that  predict  functional
sgRNAs  (Doench  et  al.,  2014).  Likewise,  several  publications  have
demonstrated  variable  levels  of  off-target  cleavage  for  speciﬁc
sgRNAs  (Cong  et  al.,  2013;  Cho  et  al.,  2014;  Fu  et  al.,  2013;  Lin
et  al.,  2014;  Pattanayak  et  al.,  2013;  Hsu  et  al.,  2013).  For  exam-
ple,  Fu  et  al.  (2013)  examined  the  activity  of  sgRNAs  that  contained
single,  double,  and  multiple  mismatches  with  the  target  DNA.
Their  results  demonstrated  that,  in  general,  single  mismatches  are
well-tolerated  at  the  5(cid:3) end  of  the  sgRNA,  adjacent  double  mis-
matches  can  still  result  in  cleavage  for  some  sequences,  and  three
or  more  adjacent  mismatches  at  the  5(cid:3) end  of  the  sgRNA  elim-
inate  activity.  When  testing  potential  off-target  sites  that  were
predicted  bioinformatically,  CRISPR–Cas9-dependent  cleavage  was
only  detected  at  a  small  subset  of  these  endogenous  potential
off-target  sites.  In  addition,  off-targeting  was  demonstrated  using
sequences  containing  up  to  ﬁve  nonadjacent  mismatches  to  their
target,  suggesting  that  sequences  with  more  mismatches  to  a
potential  off-target  do  not  necessarily  yield  reduced  off-targeting.
Off-target  sites  including  DNA  or  RNA  bulges  at  certain  positions
relative  to  the  sgRNA  strand  have  also  been  shown  to  be  cleaved
by  CRISPR–Cas9  (Lin  et  al.,  2014).  These  results  show  context  and
sequence  dependencies  including  a  correlation  with  GC  content.
In  contrast,  whole-genome  next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  of
human  pluripotent  stem  cell  (PSC)  clones  or  induced  PSC  clones
targeted  with  CRISPR–Cas9  showed  very  few  to  no  off-target  muta-
tions  that  could  be  attributed  to  CRISPR–Cas9  (Smith  et  al.,  2014;
Veres  et  al.,  2014).  In  these  studies,  clonal  artifacts  derived  from
isolating  CRISPR–Cas9-edited  cells  appeared  to  be  a  larger  con-
cern,  suggesting  that  off-targeting  is  not  a  signiﬁcant  issue  for
using  CRISPR–Cas9  in  human  PSCs.  The  rules  governing  which  mis-
matches  between  the  crRNA  and  target  DNA  are  tolerated  and
therefore  result  in  off-target  effects  remain  unclear.

In  consideration  of  the  variety  of  reports  outlined  above,  we
performed  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  off-target  potential  of
crRNAs  containing  mismatches  with  the  target  DNA.  While  Fu
et  al.  evaluated  transversion  mutations  at  all  possible  single  mis-
matches  throughout  19  of  the  20  nucleotides,  their  evaluation  of
double  mismatches  was  limited  to  adjacent  mismatches  and  a  sub-
set  of  variably  spaced  ones.  Likewise,  Hsu  et  al.  evaluated  varying
combinations  of  mismatches,  both  interspersed  and  concatenated,
but  they  did  not  assess  all  possible  mismatch  combinations,  likely
due  to  the  technical  infeasibility  of  generating  and  assaying  large
numbers  of  sgRNA  designs.  Here,  we  exploit  a  functional  assay
paired  with  synthetic  crRNAs  to  assess  the  effects  of  mismatches
in  a  high-throughput  manner,  including  a  comprehensive  analysis
of  all  possible  crRNA  positions  containing  two  mismatches.  This
approach  allows  for  a  systematic  and  thorough  investigation  of
positional  preferences  in  off-targeting,  since  a  very  large  number
of  combinations  can  be  tested  without  prior  knowledge  of  whether
the  off-target  sites  occur  endogenously  in  the  genome  alongside  a
PAM.  In  a  genomewide  study  design,  for  instance  utilizing  NGS,  a
much  larger  set  of  crRNAs  would  have  to  be  assayed  to  represent
every  position  in  the  crRNA  targeting  sequences  with  the  assurance
that  all  or  a  large  number  of  the  potential  off-target  sequences  were
represented  in  silico.

2.  Materials  and  methods

2.1.  Generating  a  stable  cell  line  expressing  Cas9

2.1.1.  Cas9  lentiviral  particle  production

A  lentiviral  vector  containing  a  human  codon-optimized  Strepto-
coccus  pyogenes  Cas9  gene  under  control  of  the  hCMV  promoter  and
a  puromycin  resistance  gene  was  packaged  into  lentiviral  particles

using  the  Trans-Lentiviral  Packaging  Kit  (Dharmacon,  #TLP5919)
(Kappes  and  Wu,   2001;  Kappes  et  al.,  2003).

2.1.2.  Creation  of  Cas9  stable  cell  lines

Recombinant  U2OS  cells  that  stably  express  a  mutant  human
ubiquitin  fused  to  EGFP  (Thermo  Scientiﬁc  BioImage  Proteasome
Redistribution  Assay,  #R0402102)  were  seeded  at  100,000  cells
per  well  in  a  24-well  plate  (Costar,  #3524).  The  following  day,
␮L  of  Cas9  lentiviral  particles  (rough
cells  were  transduced  with  3 
×
  106 viral  particles  per  mL).  The  cells
estimate  of  viral  titer:  1 
were  expanded  into  a  6-well  plate  (Thermo  Scientiﬁc,  #140675)
72  h  post-transduction.  After  a  48-hour  recovery  and  expansion
␮g/mL  of  puromycin  (Invivo-
period,  the  cells  were  exposed  to  2 
gen,  #ant-pr-5).  Cells  that  survived  the  selection  were  harvested
and  utilized  in  the  following  experiments  and  are  referred  to  as
Ubi-GFP  U2OS–Cas9.

2.2.  Design  of  crRNA  and  tracrRNA

Full-length  crRNAs  were  designed  by  appending  the  S.  pyogenes
crRNA  repeat  sequence,  5(cid:3) GUUUUAGAGCUAUGCUGUUUUG  3(cid:3),  to
each  target  sequence.

crRNAs  were  designed  to  target  VCP,  PPIB,  MYBB1,  DNMT3B,
CDKNIA,  VEGFA  and  EMX1  (Supplementary  Table  1).  VEGFA  and
EMX1  crRNA  sequences  were  obtained  from  Fu  et  al.  (2013).  For
saturation  studies,  266  crRNAs  to  most  positions  across  the  VCP
were  designed  (Supplementary  Table  2).
For  speciﬁcity  studies,  two   functional  target  sequences  were
selected  (VCP  2:  5(cid:3) UCAUCAACAAUUAACCGAUU  3(cid:3) and  PSMD7  1:
5(cid:3) AGCGGGGUGUGUCGCGAUGC  3(cid:3)).  For  each  one,  a  set  of  alternate
sequences  with  disruptive  2-base  mismatches  across  the  ﬁrst  20
targeting  nucleotides  was  designed  by  replacement  of  each  base
with  its  Watson–Crick  partner  (A–U,  U–A,  G–C,  and  C–G)  at  two
separate  positions  in  all  possible  combinations  of  positions.  This
resulted  in  190  2-base  mismatch  sequences  for  each  of  the  two
crRNAs  (Supplementary  Table  3).

2.3.  Synthesis  of  crRNA  and  tracrRNA

All  crRNAs  and  tracrRNA  were  chemically  synthesized  on
solid-phase  support  using  5(cid:3)-silyl-2(cid:3)-orthoester  (ACE)  chemistry
(Scaringe,  2001;  Wincott  et  al.,  1995).  crRNAs  were  deprotected,
desalted,  and  used  without  further  puriﬁcation.  The  tracrRNA  was
additionally  HPLC-puriﬁed.

2.4.  Transfections

HEK293T,  Ubi-GFP  U2OS–Cas9,  U2OS  and  ESD3  cells  were
seeded  in  a  96-well  plate  in  a  density  appropriate  for  each  spe-
ciﬁc  assay.  The  following  day  crRNA  and  tracrRNA  were  individually
resuspended  in  10  mM  Tris–HCl  (pH7.5),  100  mM  NaC,  and  1  mM
␮M  crRNA  and  tracrRNA  were  added  together  and  the
EDTA.  100 
␮M  using  sterile  1X  siRNA  Buffer
RNA  was   further  diluted  to  5 
(Dharmacon,  B-002000-UB-100).  A  ﬁnal  concentration  of  50  nM
crRNA:tracrRNA  (50  nM  of  each  crRNA  and  tracrRNA)  was  used
for  transfection.  The  cells  were  transfected  with  DharmaFECT  Duo
Transfection  Reagent  (Dharmacon,  #  T-2010-03)  using  100  ng  of
Cas9  plasmid  (for  co-transfections)  and  50  nM  crRNA:tracrRNA
complex.

2.5.  Genomic  DNA  isolation  and  mismatch-detection  assay

3.  Results

Genomic  DNA  was  isolated  72  h  post-transfection  by  direct  lysis
of  the  cells  in  Phusion  HF  buffer  (Thermo  Scientiﬁc,  #F-518L),  pro-
teinase  K  and  RNase  A  for  1  h  at  56 ◦C  followed  by  heat  inactivation
at  96 ◦C  for  5  min.  PCR  was   performed  with  primers  ﬂanking  the
cleavage  sites  (Supplementary  Table  4).  500  ng  of  PCR  products  was
treated  with  T7  endonuclease  I  (T7EI;  NEB,  #M0302L)  for  25  min   at
37 ◦C  and  the  samples  were  separated  on  a  2%  agarose  gel.  Percent
editing  in  each  sample  was  calculated  using  ImageJ.

2.6.  Sanger  sequencing

Blunt-end  PCR  products  generated  for  the  mismatch-detection
assay  were  cloned  into  pCR-Blunt  using  the  Zero  Blunt  PCR  Cloning
Kit  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  protocol  (Life  Technologies,
#K2700-20).  Transformed  colonies  were  picked  into  96-well  plates
and  grown  overnight  in  NZYM  PLUS  broth  (Teknova,  #N1220)
and  8%  glycerol.  Frozen  96-well  plates  were  sent  to  Oblique  Bio,
Inc.  (Huntsville,  AL)  for  mini-prep  and  Sanger  sequencing.  Chro-
matograms  were  analyzed  with  Geneious  Version  6.1.8,  created  by
Biomatters  (www.geneious.com).

2.7.  Functional  screening  of  gene  editing

2.7.1.  Proteasome  assay

Ubi-GFP  U2OS–Cas9  cells  were  plated  at  3500  cells  per  well  in
Costar  Black  96-well  tissue  culture  treated  plates  (Costar,  #3916)
in  DMEM  high  glucose  supplemented  with  10%  fetal  bovine  serum.
Cells  were  incubated  at  37 ◦C,  5%  CO2 for  24  h  before  transfection.
␮L/well  Dharma-
Cells  were  transfected  in  triplicate  using  0.08 
FECT  #3  (Dharmacon,  T-2003-01)  diluted  in  reduced  serum  media
(HyClone,  SH30564.01).  Cells  were  returned  to  the  37 ◦C,  5%  CO2
incubator  for  72  h  prior  to  analysis.

2.7.2.  ArrayScan  detection

Cells  were  washed  with  1X  DPBS  and  treated  with  4%
paraformaldehyde  for  30  min.  Cells  were  then  washed  two   times
with  1X  DPBS  and  Hoechst  stained  for  5  min.  Plates  were  analyzed
on  the  Cellomics  ArrayScan  VTI  HCS  Reader  (Thermo  Scientiﬁc)
×
at  5 
  magniﬁcation,  using  a  target  activation  method  in  the  Cel-
lomicsScan  Software  (Thermo  Scientiﬁc),  where  GFP-positive  cells
are  identiﬁed  as  selected  cells.  A  total  of  nine  ﬁelds  of  view  at  5×
were  imaged  per  well.  Total  number  of  cells  and  percent  selected
cells  were  reported  and  used  for  analysis.  Individual  images  were
analyzed  for  artifacts  that  could  be  erroneously  calculated  as  GFP-
positive  cells  by  the  analysis  software;  any  wells  containing  these
artifacts  were  discarded  from  the  data  set.

2.7.3.  Data  analysis

the  positive  control 

Percent  selected  (GFP  positive)  cells  per  well  for  each  bio-
logical  triplicate  were  normalized  to  average  of  percent  selected

  median(sample)/MAD(sample)

crRNA  to  the  targets  VCP  2  or  PSMD7  1  with  a  robust  z-score  of
>100  was  selected  as  a  hit;  this  score  threshold  was   chosen  as  it
identiﬁes  all  positive  controls  and  no  negative  controls.

3.1.  Efﬁcient  gene  editing  using  Cas9  and  synthetic  crRNA  and
tracrRNA

Most  published  studies  using  CRISPR–Cas9  for  gene  editing  have
used  a  sgRNA  cloned  into  and  expressed  from  a  plasmid  to  direct
target  cleavage.  A  wide  range  of  gene  editing  efﬁciencies  have  been
reported  (<1–>50%),  depending  on  the  sgRNA  and  the  target.  While
the  use  of  a  sgRNA  is  convenient  for  expression  from  a  plasmid,  this
approach  requires  cloning  and  sequence  veriﬁcation  of  every  con-
struct;  this  approach  is  not  amenable  to  high-throughput  screening
of  crRNA  sequences.  We   referred  back  to  the  original  bacterial
Type  II  CRISPR  system  and  used  a  two-RNA  approach,  combining
expression  of  the  Cas9  protein  with  delivery  of  two   synthetic  RNA
molecules  endogenous  to  the  bacterial  CRISPR–Cas9  system:  the
processed  (or  mature)  42-mer  crRNA  and  the  74-mer  tracrRNA
(nucleotides  15–89  of  the  primary  transcript,  derived  from  Sup-
plementary  Table  1  of  Jinek  et  al.  (2012))  (Fig.  1A).  We   synthesized
these  two  RNA  molecules  using  2(cid:3)ACE  RNA  chemistry,  resulting  in
high  yield  and  purity  of  full-length  RNA.

We  tested  the  efﬁciency  of  genome  editing  using  synthetic
crRNA  and  tracrRNA  molecules  on  several  gene  targets,  including
those  that  have  been  published  using  sgRNAs.  A  mismatch-
detection  assay  (for  example,  SURVEYOR  or  T7EI;  Fig.  1B–E)  is
typically  used  for  the  detection  and  quantiﬁcation  of  insertions
and  deletions  (indel)  mutations  created  by  the  CRISPR–Cas9  sys-
tem  (Vouillot  et  al.,  2015).  As  shown  in  Fig.  1B,  co-transfection  of  a
plasmid  expressing  Cas9  in  combination  with  synthetic  crRNA  and
tracrRNA  results  in  indels  at  the  targeted  site.  The  dual  synthetic
RNA  approach  is  also  effective  in  multiple  cell  lines  (Supplemen-
tary  Fig.  1A,B).  To  evaluate  the  off-target  proﬁle  of  Cas9  targeting
using  synthetic  crRNAs  and  tracrRNA,  we   designed  and  synthesized
crRNA  molecules  to  three  sequences  in  the  human  genome  (two
sites  in  VEGFA  and  one  site  in  EMX1)  that  have  previously  been
shown  by  a  mismatch-detection  assay  to  result  not  only  in  effec-
tive  target  cleavage  but  also  in  off-target  editing  at  other  sites  in
the  genome  (Fu  et  al.,  2013).  We   detected  off-target  editing  at  the
same  locations  reported  for  sgRNAs  (Fig.  1C–E,  Supplementary  Fig,
2),  and  the  efﬁciency  of  these  events  was  consistent  with  efﬁcien-
cies  reported  for  sgRNAs  (Mali  et  al.,  2013),  as  detected  by  the  T7EI
mismatch-detection  assay.  These  data  demonstrate  that  the  use  of
synthetic  crRNA  and  tracrRNA  molecules  results  in  a  similar  pat-
tern  of  on-  and  off-targeting  in  mammalian  cells  when  compared

3.2.  Evaluation  of  a  functional  reporter  assay  to  assess  gene
editing  in  a  high-throughput  manner

Because  the  sequence  of  the  tracrRNA  is  constant  regardless
of  the  crRNA  sequence,  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  different
crRNA  targeting  sequences  can  be  evaluated  in  a  high-throughput
manner  simply  by  synthesizing  the  42-mer  crRNA  sequence  and
co-transfecting  it  with  tracrRNA.  We   applied  this  approach  to
design  a  high-throughput  assay  which  evaluates  CRISPR–Cas9-
mediated  on-  and  off-targeting  in  mammalian  cells.  Although
mismatch-detection  assays  (Fig.  1B–E)  are  fairly  straight-forward,
they  are  time-consuming,  require  identiﬁcation  and  validation  of
PCR  primers  for  each  target  site,  and  are  not  suitable  for  high-
throughput  screening  of  crRNAs.  We   therefore  validated  a  reporter
cell  line  stably  expressing  EGFP  fused  to  a  non-cleavable  mutant
ubiquitin  moiety  as  a  functional  readout  of  CRISPR–Cas9  gene  edit-
ing  (Dantuma  et  al.,  2000).  These  Ubi-GFP  U2OS  cells  constitutively
degrade  the  EGFP  fusion  through  the  proteasome  pathway,  result-
ing  in  little  to  no  GFP  ﬂuorescence.  However,  if  the  proteasome
complex  or  pathway  is  compromised  or  disrupted,  the  EGFP  fusion

synthetic  crRNA  and  tracrRNA.  (B)  Co-transfection  of  a  plasmid  expressing  a  humanized  Cas9  and  synthetic  crRNA  and  synthetic  tracrRNA  results  in  targeted  DNA  cleavage
in   HEK293T  cells.  Cells  were  transfected  with  Cas9  plasmid,  synthetic  crRNA,  and  synthetic  tracrRNA,  and  compared  to  untransfected  cells  (UT)  using  the  T7  endonuclease
I   (T7EI)  assay.  The  percent  editing  after  72  h  is  indicated  at  the  bottom  of  each  lane.  (C–E)  Transfections  were  performed  as  in  (B)  and  off-target  gene  editing  with  synthetic
crRNA   and  tracrRNA  was  determined  for  VEGFA  (C–D)  and  EMX1  (E)  as  previously  validated  with  sgRNA  (Fu  et  al.,  2013).  Red  asterisks  indicate  non-speciﬁc  bands  that  are
present   in  untransfected  samples  and  were  not  included  in  the  indel  quantiﬁcation  (For  interpretation  of  the  references  to  color  in  this  ﬁgure  legend,  the  reader  is  referred

Ubi-GFP.

We  additionally  stably 

integrated  the  Cas9  gene 

into  this
reporter  cell  line  and  performed  CRISPR–Cas9  gene  editing  by
transfecting  synthetic  crRNAs  and  tracrRNA  targeting  known  com-
ponents  of  the  proteasome  that  we  had  previously  validated  using
siRNAs  (data  not  shown).  As  seen  in  Fig.  2A,  crRNAs  targeting
VCP  and  PSMD7  resulted  in  detectable  levels  of  EGFP,  indicating
that  proteasome  function  had  been  disrupted  in  these  cells,  while
there  was  no  increase  in  EGFP  ﬂuorescence  in  untreated  cells.

The  transfections  were  performed  at  a  saturating  concentration
of  50  nM  crRNA  and  tracrRNA  to  ensure  maximal  editing  activ-
ity.  The  sensitivity  of  this  reporter  assay  is  high  due  to  the  very
low  levels  of  background  in  untreated  cells  (0–5  cells,  where  in  an
average  well  approximately  7700  cells  are  analyzed;  0.06%);  we
can  therefore  conﬁdently  detect  positive  functional  activity  with
statistical  signiﬁcance  down  to  10%  or  less  activity  of  the  perfectly-
matched  crRNA.  For  instance,  for  a  perfectly-matched  target,  1500
cells  are  functionally  disrupted  in  proteasome  activity  and  there-
fore  are  EGFP-positive  (22%).  While  6  cells  can  theoretically  be
